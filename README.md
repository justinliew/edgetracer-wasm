# Ray Tracing at the Edge

This repo is a prototype of a ray tracer based on [Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

My intention is to use this to test assumptions and do analysis on whether it would be feasible and worthwhile to pursue this idea further. If the results look positive, I will probably port [pbrt](pbrt.org) to Rust and apply a similar model.

Currently this repo mainly implements main.rs, and copies the rendering implementation from the [Edgetracer](https://github.com/justinliew/edgetracer) repo which is a CLI version. See that repo for more on this experiment.
